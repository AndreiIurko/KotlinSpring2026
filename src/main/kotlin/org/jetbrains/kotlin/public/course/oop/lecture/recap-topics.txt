1. Definition of Object. Example of invariant, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism

2. Constructors + init (Superclass primary constructor -> superclass init block -> superclass secondary constructor -> 
class primary constructor -> class init block -> class secondary constructor

3. Abstraction - example of interface vs. abstract class, abstract fun/property

4. Encapsulation - example of private/protected/open/final/etc.

5. Inheritance - show example of the cat

6. Polymorphism - also example from notebook

7. Properties - get/set examples, without backing field as well

8. Operator overloading from the notebook

9. Extension functions - examples, under the hood, compile-time determination of that to execute

10. Data class - regular class, but with some methods + final (can extend other classes)

11. Enum classes - good for constants, cannot extend other classes

12. Sealed class - good for "generic" constants

13. Companion object: used when "static" objects/functions are needed tied to the class
